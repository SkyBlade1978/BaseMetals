# Migrating from Base Metals 1.10 or 1.12

Always upgrade a copy and retain the original legacy world. Install Base Metals
3.0.0 and OreSpawn 4.0.1, but do not carry MMDLib, Additional Loot Tables, the
OreSpawn 3 plugin, or the old native fallback generator into the 1.18 instance.

Minecraft's data fixer cannot identify third-party numeric block IDs from
before the 1.13 flattening. Base Metals snapshots those positions, runs
Mojang's complete chunk fixes through the 1.13 palette transition, and then
overlays only the saved third-party blocks and their original block entities.
Any vanilla block entities which Mojang's fixer inferred from a reused mod
numeric ID are removed at those positions. Vanilla's context-sensitive block,
block-entity, entity, inventory, map, statistics, objective, jukebox, spawn
egg, banner, and villager fixes still run everywhere else. The migrator reads
the exact numeric map from an untouched legacy `level.dat` or `level.dat_old`
when available. If neither retains a legacy map, it uses the map captured from
the public Base Metals 2.5.0-rc2.332 and MMDLib 1.0.0-rc2.36 runtime.

Before replacing any region file, `level.dat`, or playerdata file, the
migrator copies the original to
`basemetals-1.12-region-backup` inside the world. Region replacements are
transactional. A completed scan writes
`BASEMETALS_1_12_BLOCK_MIGRATION_COMPLETE.txt`, recording either the conversion
summary or that no legacy content was present; subsequent starts do nothing.
The fresh direct-upgrade fixture retained 20,553 block-state placements,
1,038 exact chest stacks, 96 equipped armor stacks, 33 filled-fluid buckets,
and nine player-inventory stacks across the Overworld, Nether, and End.
Separate DataVersion-512 validation covers both public 1.10 lines. A bounded
copy of a Cyano 2.4.0 world retained every one of 323,429 Base Metals block
positions, 10,153 mod-block entities, and 378 Base Metals stacks. A world made
with the public MMD 2.5.0-beta4.238 release retained all 345 registered block
IDs and all 1,030 registered item IDs, then completed a 1.18 server start.

The packaged fallback map covers the exact public 1.12 runtime. With a saved
legacy registry map, blocks from the world's other 1.10/1.12 mods also retain
their registry name and original block-entity data, although block states
without a Base Metals-owned metadata decoder fall back to that mod's default
state. Base Metals and historical `mmdlib:*` states retain their old metadata
semantics, including complete paired-door state. If neither legacy level file
contains an ID used by a numeric chunk, migration stops instead of guessing or
deleting it. Restore the backed-up regions and recover the world's original
`level.dat_old` before retrying. Forge normally creates that file before Base
Metals' migration hook runs; keep it beside `level.dat` for the first upgrade.
This supports both the original Cyano Base Metals 2.4 line and the later MMD
Base Metals 2.5 line. Registry paths containing uppercase characters, which
Minecraft 1.10 still allowed, are normalized to the lowercase form required by
modern Minecraft.

Base Metals 3.0.0 preserves historical `basemetals:*` IDs, including hidden
`double_<material>_slab` blocks and molten-fluid block IDs such as
`basemetals:adamantine`. Dedicated bucket items and flowing-fluid registry
entries are new. Legacy `forge:bucketfilled` stacks containing Base Metals
fluids become the corresponding dedicated bucket, and damage on old Base
Metals/MMDLib tools and armor is preserved instead of being consumed as
pre-flattening item metadata. Dedicated-server playerdata and the embedded
single-player inventory in `level.dat` follow the same conversion on the first
upgrade start. Missing mappings also forward:

- `basemetals:liquid_mercury` to `basemetals:mercury`;
- `basemetals:carbon_powder` to `basemetals:coal_powder`;
- Cyano-era `basemetals:<material>_door_item` IDs to the corresponding
  `basemetals:<material>_door`;
- Cyano-era `basemetals:iron_nugget` to `minecraft:iron_nugget`, and its
  `basemetals:liquid_mercury` block item to `basemetals:mercury_bucket`;
- historical `mmdlib:*` Vanilla Bits blocks, items, and fluids to matching
  `basemetals:*` IDs.

## OreSpawn 3 configuration

OreSpawn 4.0.1 migrates OS3 files before merging provider defaults. When an
installed provider has one rule whose output matches a legacy rule, the old
values are written under that provider rule ID. Explicit user values,
including enabled legacy Base Metals copper, therefore survive without a
duplicate rule. Ambiguous and unmatched outputs retain legacy IDs and are
listed in `config/orespawn-migration/migration-report.txt`.

Fresh profiles use the provider defaults in [WORLDGEN.md](WORLDGEN.md).
Migrated profiles retain explicit enabled flags, quantities, frequencies,
dimensions, and heights.

The generated manifests at `data/basemetals/registry_manifest_1_12.json` and
`data/basemetals/registry_manifest.json` document the runtime baseline,
restored content, and explicit 1.18 additions.
